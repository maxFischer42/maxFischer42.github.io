            "As a Tech Student at PNNL, I worked alongside my mentor in the Data Integration group to build a full-stack application to create a system for easily viewing radar images in a web application. This project helped build a lot of skills that made me the programmer I am today; requiring me to learn PHP, JavaScript, and ReactJS. To this day, this project has been the biggest impact on my abilities as a software engineer."

            "Serving as a Teaching/Learning Assistant for multiple different computer science classes at WSU Tri-Cities, my role varied depending on the class. For CS 121, the Introductory Computer Science class, I was tasked to assist with running labs every week while hosting office hours every week. For CS 322, the Software Engineering Principles class, I served as an assistant to the Professor; I helped him with scoring assignments such as Requirement Specification documents as well as held office hours weekly to assist students on their semester project of building a Turing Machine."

            "In my role as TRIO Support Staff, I was hired on to construct and teach a summer class in 2023 for video game design, specifically an Introduction to the Unity Engine course for WSUâ€™s TRIO program. In the months prior to starting class, I built a game and curriculum to instruct a top-down action game with multiple different kinds of mechanics. Movement, combat, pathfinding and more were incorporated into the project. The class itself lasted 3 weeks from the end of July until halfway through August."
